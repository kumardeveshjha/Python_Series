# Pandas 

Pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool,

There are many objects in the panadas, but the two main tool are:
1. Pandas Series
2. Pandas DataFrame

## The pandas series objects 

1. When we make any series object from a given list it automatically adds the index. 
2. we have also option to make a custom oject by making two diffrent lists and pass one as the insdex
3. We can also use python dictionary as key value pair. 

##  Now we come to the real world data 

1. We uses the pd.read_csv (For comma separated values) files
2. Now then storing that data and convert this data to series to DataFrame

3. using squeeze() method we can convert the data from DataFrame to series 

## Important Methods of Series when reading the realtime data

1. Head() and tail() :-> These gives upper or lower top bottom 5 data rows 
2. sample() :-> Gives randomaly data rows
