# Namespaces
A namespace is a space that holds names(identifiers).Programmatically speaking, namespaces are dictionary of identifiers(keys) and their objects(values)

There are 4 types of namespaces:

1.Builtin Namespace
2.Global Namespace
3.Enclosing Namespace
4.Local Namespace


# Scope and LEGB(Local Enclosing Global Builtin) Rule
-- A scope is a textual region of a Python program where a namespace is directly accessible.

-- The interpreter searches for a name from the inside out, looking in the local, enclosing, global, and finally the built-in scope. If the interpreter doesnâ€™t find the name in any of these locations, then Python raises a NameError exception.

# Decorators
A decorator in python is a function that receives another function as input and adds some functionality(decoration) to and it and returns it.

# This can happen only because python functions are 1st class citizens.

There are 2 types of decorators available in python

Built in decorators like @staticmethod, @classmethod, @abstractmethod and @property etc
User defined decorators that we programmers can create according to our needs

-- The whole concept of decorator is that the child can access the properties of parent properties even after the function has returned the value and closed but the values still are there in the scope for the inner function to be executed and use the values .

# Usefulness of Decorators
