What is NumPy?

1. NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python
2. Provides multidimensional array object
3. Fast operations on arrays 
4. At the core of the NumPy package, is the ndarray object.This encapsulates n-dimensional arrays of homogeneous data types

5. NumPy is a datatype of C
6. Numpy - Pandas , Scikit.
7. Numpy has fixed sized array
8. It helps in doing mathematical calculation

Numpy Arrays Vs Python Lists 

1. In terms of [Speed] 

The numpy is about [50-times] faster than the python lists 

Becase Numpy uses the c-type array, static array and not a referential array means it stores the data into the memory

But in python list the data is stored as the refence the address of teh data.


2. In terms of [memory] 

The numpy takes less storage than the lists because it has multiple ways to store the data 

In Short 
1. The Numpy is faster than the built-in data type of python named Lists 
2. The Numpy takes less memory than lists because it has multiple ways to store the data 
3. It is convinient to work in with the numpy over lists 

## Fancy Indexing and Boolean indexing 


# *****************Broadcasting *************************

Why we need broadcasting ?? 
When we have [different] [shapes] of [arrays] and want to perform a arithmatical operations 

Numpy do it own 

Broadcasting Rules 
1. Every array can not be broadcated
